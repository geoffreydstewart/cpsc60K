CPSC 60000 Week 4 Iterator

The project for this weeks assignment is in the CloudVMBatchOrderAssembler directory. It assembles two different batches of Orders and uses the Iterator Design Pattern to uniformly iterate each group, even though their underlying implementations are different. I have reused some code from my Factory Design Pattern assignment, for the sole purpose of creating VM orders. It is kept separate in the "factory package". The focus of the assignment is Iterator Design Pattern in the "iterator" package.

The project uses JUnit 5 for unit testing. The test class is located in the src/test directory.
